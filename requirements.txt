# Developer Instructions
# -----------------------------

# 1. Make sure Python 3.10+ is installed.

# 2. (Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:
# (A virtual environment is an isolated Python workspace that keeps a project’s 
# dependencies separate from the system Python, preventing version conflicts and making the project easier to manage and share.)
#   
# Linux/macOS:
#      run "python -m venv venv" 
#       source venv/bin/activate
#    Windows:
#       python -m venv venv
#       venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install Python dependencies:
#     run "pip install -r requirements.txt" in terminal to download dependencies

# 4. Install Ollama desktop app for local testing:
#    Download from: https://ollama.ai/download
#    Install the model used in the code: "llama3.1:8b" when in Ollama app
#    Make sure the Ollama app is running while using this program.

# 5. Run the Flask app:
#    run "python app.py" in the terminal
#    Then open your browser at: http://127.0.0.1:5000
#    "Ctrl+c" in terminal to end code

# Notes
# -----------------------------
# - Ensure the Ollama model "llama3.1:8b" is downloaded locally; otherwise,
#   the summarization will not work.
# - If you face any issues with PyPDF2 or python-docx, make sure you have
#   updated versions installed.
# - This setup is for local development/testing. For deployment, additional
#   steps may be required.
